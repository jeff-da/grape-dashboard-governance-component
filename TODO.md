Requirements

Replicate the Meanfi dashboard such that we can do the following

- See a list of all streaming payments associated with a wallet
- See further data associated with a stream, specifically: Recieving from Address, Payment rate, Date started, funds left, reserved allocated and funds available to withdraw, 
- The user should be able to switch between money streams to see the stats above for individual money streams
- The user should be able to re-fresh the money streams via a button
- The user should be able to withdraw funds via a withdraw button
- The general design should mimic the design of the current mean dashboard.
